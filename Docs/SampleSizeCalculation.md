# Sample Size Calculation for Bug Verification

## Introduction

When dealing with an intermittent bug that occurs approximately 23.67% of the time, it's essential to determine an appropriate sample size to verify if a proposed solution effectively resolves the issue. This document outlines the steps to calculate the required sample size for statistical verification.

## Parameters

1. **Current Proportion (p0)**: 0.236666 (23.67%)
2. **Desired Proportion (p1)**: A lower value, e.g., 0.05 (5%), to test for a significant reduction.
3. **Confidence Level (α)**: Commonly set at 0.05 for 95% confidence.
4. **Power (1 - β)**: Typically set at 0.80 for 80% power.

## Sample Size Formula

The sample size for comparing two proportions can be calculated using the following formula:

\[
n = \left( \frac{Z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{2p(1-p)} + Z_{\beta} \sqrt{p_0(1-p_0) + p_1(1-p_1)}}{p_1 - p_0} \right)^2
\]

### Where:
- \( p = \frac{p_0 + p_1}{2} \) (average of the two proportions)
- \( Z_{\alpha/2} \): Z-score for the desired confidence level.
- \( Z_{\beta} \): Z-score for the desired power.

## Z-scores

- For a 95% confidence level: \( Z_{\alpha/2} \approx 1.96 \)
- For 80% power: \( Z_{\beta} \approx 0.84 \)

## Calculation Steps

1. **Calculate the average proportion**:
   \[
   p = \frac{0.236666 + 0.05}{2} \approx 0.143333
   \]

2. **Substitute values into the formula**:
   - Using \( p_0 = 0.236666 \) and \( p_1 = 0.05 \):
   \[
   n = \left( \frac{1.96 \sqrt{2(0.143333)(1-0.143333)} + 0.84 \sqrt{0.236666(1-0.236666) + 0.05(1-0.05)}}{0.05 - 0.236666} \right)^2
   \]

## Conclusion

After performing the calculations, you will obtain the required sample size \( n \). Generally, for verification of this nature, a sample size of around 100 to 200 is common to detect significant changes in proportions with reasonable confidence. For precise results, consider using statistical software or a sample size calculator tailored to your specific parameters.
