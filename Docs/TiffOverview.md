# Overview of the TIFF File Format

The TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a flexible and extensible format for storing raster graphics. Originally developed in the 1980s, it is widely used in the graphic arts, photography, and publishing industries due to its ability to store high-quality images with rich color information and extensive metadata.

## Key Features of TIFF

- **Flexibility**: Supports various color spaces, including grayscale, RGB, CMYK, and YCbCr.
- **Extensibility**: Allows for custom tags, making it adaptable to different applications.
- **Lossless Compression**: Supports various compression methods, including LZW and ZIP, ensuring no loss in image quality.
- **Multiple Pages**: Can store multiple images in a single file, making it suitable for documents with multiple pages.

## Common Uses

- **Archiving**: Due to its high quality and support for metadata, TIFF is often used for archiving images in libraries and museums.
- **Publishing**: Frequently used in the publishing industry for print-ready images.
- **Digital Photography**: Many cameras and scanners use TIFF as a standard format for high-quality images.
