Storage Manager via API notes

- 6 setting sfor camera config 3 for smb 

use jthread
or future and promises for iteration 2
thread ID object if it exists blocks any other operation

list files - Some form of dictuonary to store result
 - Store some sort of parameter to funct with the same path, return the
   next iteration of results

Take care for cancellations:
    - ls for loop going thru files
    - does std::filesystem sort files or return them unordered?
    - sort abort?
    - operations need to be abortable.
    - Dont kill thread
    - threaded solution aborts for all operation

Notify after the information/result has been moved to the cached member of
the object AND after the operation has been validated to not be cancelled.

Use a mutex to ensure that IFF you're in the last part of the work thread
cancellation is not possible. IE after notify event has been sent, reject
the cancellation.

Cancellation ALWAYS blockiong & returns immediately.
