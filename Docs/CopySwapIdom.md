# The Copy-Swap Idiom in C++

## Introduction

The copy-swap idiom is a design pattern in C++ that helps manage resource ownership and provides a strong exception safety guarantee. It combines the concepts of copy construction and swap operations to simplify resource management, especially in classes that handle dynamic resources.

## Exception Safety Guarantee

**Exception safety guarantees** refer to how well a program can maintain a correct state when exceptions occur. In C++, there are several levels of exception safety:

1. **No-Throw Guarantee**: The operation will not throw any exceptions.
2. **Strong Guarantee**: If an exception is thrown, the program state remains unchanged (the operation is atomic).
3. **Basic Guarantee**: If an exception is thrown, some changes may occur, but the object will remain in a valid state.

The copy-swap idiom provides a **strong guarantee**. If an exception occurs during the copy construction, the original object remains unchanged. If the swap operation fails, the original object's state is unaffected, ensuring that the object is always valid.

## How It Works

1. **Copy Constructor**: Initializes a new object as a copy of an existing object.
2. **Swap Function**: Exchanges the contents of two objects.
3. **Assignment Operator**: Uses the copy-swap idiom to handle self-assignment and resource management.

## Key Steps

1. **Copy the Object**: Create a copy of the right-hand side object.
2. **Swap**: Swap the contents of the current object with the copy.
3. **Destructor**: The temporary copy goes out of scope, automatically releasing its resources.

## Self-Assignment Handling

Self-assignment occurs when an object is assigned to itself. The copy-swap idiom manages this safely because the swap operation is designed to work even if the two objects being swapped are the same.

## Example Code

Here's a simple implementation of the copy-swap idiom in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

class Resource {
public:
    Resource(int value) : value(new int(value)) {}
    
    // Copy Constructor
    Resource(const Resource& other) : value(new int(*other.value)) {}
    
    // Swap function
    void swap(Resource& other) noexcept {
        std::swap(value, other.value);
    }
    
    // Assignment Operator
    Resource& operator=(Resource other) {
        swap(other); // Use copy-swap idiom
        return *this;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Resource() {
        delete value;
    }

    void display() const {
        std::cout << "Resource Value: " << *value << std::endl;
    }

private:
    int* value;
};

int main() {
    Resource res1(10);
    Resource res2(20);
    
    res1 = res2; // Assignment
    res1.display();
    
    return 0;
}
```

```
+--------------------+
|      Resource      |
|--------------------|
|   int* value       |
|--------------------|
| + Resource(int)    |
| + swap(Resource&)  |
| + operator=(...)   |
| + ~Resource()      |
+--------------------+
```

### Diagram 2: Copy-Swap Process

```
1. Copy Construction
   +--------------------+           +--------------------+
   |      Resource      |           |      Resource      |
   |--------------------|           |--------------------|
   |   int* value      |  --------> |   int* value      |
   +--------------------+           +--------------------+
         (res1)                        (copy of res1)
         
2. Swap Operation
   +--------------------+           +--------------------+
   |      Resource      |           |      Resource      |
   |--------------------|           |--------------------|
   |   int* value      |  <-------- |   int* value      |
   +--------------------+           +--------------------+
         (res1)                        (copy)
         
3. Resource Cleanup on Destruction
   +--------------------+
   |      Resource      |
   |--------------------|
   |   int* value      |
   +--------------------+
         (res1)
```

## Summary

The copy-swap idiom is a robust technique for resource management in C++. It simplifies the assignment operator implementation while ensuring **strong exception safety**. If an exception occurs during the copy construction, the original object remains unchanged, maintaining a valid state. This makes the idiom particularly useful in managing dynamic resources and avoiding memory leaks.
